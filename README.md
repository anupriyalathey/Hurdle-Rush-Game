# Hurdle Rush Game
A running game with obstacles, in which you get rewarded with RUN tokens and NFTs which can be minted into your metamask wallet and can be traded further or played in different games too.

## The problem it solves
The rewards(in-game items) like tokens and NFT in this game are stored on the blockchain which gives it an upper hand in comparison to regular games as in regular games, they are stored on a centralized server like the company launching it, which isnâ€™t censorship resistant.
Another advantage is that one item(like skins) from this game can be used in other games too and can be traded further.
